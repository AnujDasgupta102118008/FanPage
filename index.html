<h1> Introduction</h1> Hey guys , how are you all doing ?? Was having some free time so thought why not tell you a little bit about myself through Github Pages ! <br>
PS This will also be my very first webpage on GitHub :)<br>
So as you hopefully know by now that my name is Anuj Dasgupta. I am a WebDev enthusiast and currently doing my internship as a Super Developer for Avengers Clan in Spider Summer Induction Program.<br>
I completed my 2nd semester in Chemical Engineering and have made some nice friends in this one year ! I was a Event Coordinator in Nittfest Events Team and that was the first time I actually helped in organising a fest. It was a truly a good learning experience :-)
<h1> Background </h1>
I am a proud son of an Army Officer and this gives me a not so common history . I have changed my school 7 times and have lived in several cities across India including Srinagar , Chandigarh , Mumbai ! <br>
I came to this college from Mumbai , went to Delhi in my first holidays and am getting ready to shift to Secunderabad as a write this webpage . Now thats the uniqueness of defence life! This has taught me how to forge lasting friendship and how to adapt to new surroundings and thanks to this I didnt find it that difficult to settle in NITT !
<br>
<br>
<h1> Hobbies </h1>
Badminton, Lawn Tennis and Cycling are my favourites in Sports while I love to watch documentaries based on aviation and world war facts. One of my achievements is that I completed all Air Crash Investigation documentaries available on YouTube . So want to know about any crash , just ping me :))<br>
I also have interest in astrophysics and am quite amazed by the vastness and complexity of the universe. I also used to play the keyboard and often relax to instrumental music.
<br> I really really love travelling and thanks to my parents,
 I have visited 10 countries already !!
